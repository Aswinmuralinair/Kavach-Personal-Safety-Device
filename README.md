# Kavach — Personal Safety Device

Kavach is a Raspberry Pi-based personal safety device that detects emergencies (falls, heart rate spikes, danger sounds, button presses) and automatically calls the police/ambulance, sends SMS with GPS location to your guardian, and uploads encrypted evidence to a server.

## Architecture

The project has two parts that run on separate machines:

| Part | Folder | Runs on | Location |
|------|--------|---------|----------|
| **Device** (sensors + alerts) | `Personal-Safety-Device-main/` | Raspberry Pi | Anywhere (with the user) |
| **Server** (stores alerts + evidence) | `Kavach-Server-main/` | Any PC (Windows/Linux) | Anywhere (exposed via ngrok) |
| **Mobile App** (monitor + configure) | `kavach_app/` | Android phone | Anywhere (connects via ngrok) |

The Pi and server do **NOT** need to be on the same network. The server is exposed to the internet via **ngrok** (free permanent URL). The Pi can reach it from anywhere in the world.

**All data is encrypted end-to-end:**
- Telemetry (GPS, battery, alert type) → ChaCha20-Poly1305 encrypted
- Evidence files (video clips, images) → ChaCha20-Poly1305 encrypted
- File integrity → SHA-256 hashes verified server-side after decryption

---

## How the Device Works

When you run `python main.py` on the Pi, it starts 10 subsystems simultaneously:

1. **Physical Button** (GPIO 23) — polled 50 times/second for press patterns
2. **IMU** (BNO055 via I2C) — checks for falls 10 times/second
3. **Heart Rate** (MAX30102 via I2C) — reads BPM every 5 seconds
4. **Microphone + AI** (YAMNet TFLite model) — listens for screaming, gunshots, explosions
5. **Pi Camera** (CSI interface via rpicam-vid) — records 30-second MP4 evidence clips during alerts
6. **Microphone Recorder** (sounddevice) — records 42-second WAV audio evidence during alerts (auto-disables if no real mic)
7. **LoRa Radio** (SX1278 via SPI) — receives SOS from nearby Kavach devices (auto-disables if not connected)
8. **Config Sync** — polls server every 10s for config changes + sends battery heartbeat
9. **Power Monitor** (INA219 via I2C) — reads battery voltage for heartbeat reporting
10. **Keyboard** — `f`, `h`, `a`, `s`, `d`, `l`, `q` keys to simulate sensors (works on Pi and desktop)

If any sensor hardware is not connected, the code **auto-detects** and falls back to a safe no-op mode (sensors use simulators triggered by keyboard, LoRa and audio recorder silently disable if no real hardware detected).

### Triggers

| Trigger | How | Result |
|---------|-----|--------|
| Button **single press** (hold < 5s, release) | GPIO pin 23 | SOS |
| Button **double press** (two quick taps) | GPIO pin 23 | MEDICAL alert |
| Button **long press** (hold 5+ seconds) | GPIO pin 23 | SAFE — cancels active alert |
| Fall detected | IMU sensor or press `f` | SOS |
| Heart rate >= 140 BPM | Heart sensor or press `h` | SOS |
| Danger sound (screaming, gunshot, etc.) | Microphone or press `a` | SOS |
| LoRa packet received | Another Kavach device nearby | Mesh relay |

### SOS Sequence

```
Step 1 → START CAMERA + MICROPHONE RECORDING (30-sec video + 42-sec audio, staggered 3s apart)
Step 2 → UPLOAD TELEMETRY TO SERVER (immediate, so mobile app sees the alert within 5s)
Step 3 → CALL POLICE (rings 15 seconds, hangs up)
Step 4 → SMS to guardian: "SOS ALERT - Emergency triggered"
Step 4 → WhatsApp alert: location + help message (via CallMeBot)
Step 5 → Get location (GPS first, cell tower fallback if GPS fails)
         → SMS: "Location: https://maps.google.com/?q=12.97,77.59"
Step 6 → LOOP every 60 seconds until cancelled:
           ├── Check battery (WhatsApp alert if < 15%, once per boot)
           ├── Retry any queued failed uploads
           ├── Get location (5 GPS attempts → cell tower fallback)
           ├── Send updated GPS/tower location SMS
           ├── Send battery percentage SMS
           └── Encrypt + upload new evidence files to server (viewable on app + dashboard)
Step 7 → Long press button → STOP CAMERA + MIC → SMS: "I AM SAFE, alert cancelled"
         → Device returns to IDLE
```

MEDICAL alert is the same but calls the medical number and sends "MEDICAL EMERGENCY" messages.

**Only one alert can run at a time.** If SOS is already active and another trigger fires, it is ignored.

### Location Strategy

The device uses a **GPS-first, cell-tower-fallback** approach:

1. **GPS** (via SIM7600 AT+CGPSINFO) — tries 5 times (~20 seconds). Accuracy: 2-10 metres.
2. **Cell Tower** (via Unwired Labs Cloud LBS API) — if GPS fails, reads cell tower IDs (MCC, MNC, LAC, CID) from the SIM7600 via `AT+CPSI?`, then sends them to the Unwired Labs API to get coordinates. Accuracy: 100-2000 metres. Requires `api_token` in config.json (free tier: 100 requests/day at [unwiredlabs.com](https://unwiredlabs.com)).

This repeats every 60-second cycle during an active alert — so if GPS becomes available later (e.g. user moves outdoors), it automatically switches back to GPS.

## How the Server Works

The server is a Flask web app with these endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Purpose |
|--------|----------|------|---------|
| `GET` | `/` | Admin session | Admin web dashboard |
| `GET` | `/login` | None | Admin login page |
| `GET` | `/logout` | None | Admin logout |
| `POST` | `/api/alerts` | Encrypted payload | Receive encrypted telemetry + evidence from device |
| `GET` | `/api/alerts` | Session or token | List all alerts |
| `GET` | `/api/alerts/<id>` | Session or token | Alert detail with file integrity verification |
| `GET` | `/api/health` | None | Server + database health check |
| `GET` | `/uploads/<file>` | Session, token, or signed URL | Serve decrypted evidence files |
| `POST` | `/api/auth/signup` | None | Create user/guardian account for mobile app |
| `POST` | `/api/auth/login` | None | Get auth token for mobile app |
| `GET` | `/api/user/alerts` | User token | User's alerts |
| `GET` | `/api/guardian/alerts` | Guardian token | Guardian's SOS/MEDICAL alerts |
| `GET` | `/api/user/locations` | User token | Location history |
| `GET` | `/api/user/config` | User token | Get device phone numbers |
| `PUT` | `/api/user/config` | User token | Update phone numbers from app |
| `GET` | `/api/device/config/<id>` | Device key | Pi polls this for config updates + sends battery heartbeat |
| `GET` | `/api/device/status/<id>` | Session or token | Live device battery + online/offline status |
| `GET` | `/api/guardian/evidence/<id>` | Guardian token | Evidence files for alert (returns signed download URLs) |

When the device sends data:
1. Server receives the encrypted telemetry payload
2. Decrypts it using the shared ChaCha20 key
3. Receives encrypted evidence files
4. Decrypts evidence files using the shared ChaCha20 key
5. Verifies SHA-256 hashes match what the device sent (on the decrypted file)
6. Saves decrypted evidence files to `uploads/`
7. Stores alert metadata in SQLite database (`kavach.db`)

---

## Setup Guide

### 1. Generate the Encryption Key (once)

Run this on either machine:

```bash
python -c "
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.aead import ChaCha20Poly1305
import os, pathlib
pathlib.Path('keys').mkdir(exist_ok=True)
key = ChaCha20Poly1305.generate_key()
open('keys/chacha.key', 'wb').write(key)
print('Key saved to keys/chacha.key')
"
```

Copy the **exact same key file** to both machines:
```
Pi:      Personal-Safety-Device-main/keys/chacha.key
Server:  Kavach-Server-main/keys/chacha.key
```

Both must be identical — if they don't match, decryption will fail.

### 2. Install Dependencies

**On your Windows PC (server):**
```bash
cd Kavach-Server-main
pip install -r Requirements.txt
```

**On the Raspberry Pi (device):**
```bash
cd Personal-Safety-Device-main
pip install SQLAlchemy requests pyserial cryptography numpy sounddevice RPi.GPIO smbus2 spidev adafruit-circuitpython-bno055 adafruit-circuitpython-busdevice tensorflow
```

> **Note:** Camera uses `rpicam-vid` (pre-installed on Raspberry Pi OS). Also install PortAudio: `sudo apt-get install libportaudio2 portaudio19-dev`

### 3. Set Up ngrok (Remote Access — Pi and Server on different networks)

The device (Pi) and server (laptop) do NOT need to be on the same Wi-Fi. We use **ngrok** to give your laptop a permanent public URL that the Pi can reach from anywhere in the world.

**One-time setup:**

1. Install ngrok: `winget install ngrok.ngrok` (Windows) or download from [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com/download)
2. Sign up free at [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com) → get your **authtoken** from the dashboard
3. Run: `ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_TOKEN_HERE`
4. Go to **Domains** in the ngrok dashboard → click **New Domain** → get your free permanent domain (e.g. `your-name.ngrok-free.dev`)

**ngrok starts automatically** when you run `.\start.bat` — no need for a second terminal. To run ngrok manually instead:
```bash
ngrok http --domain your-name.ngrok-free.dev 8080
```

> **Note:** If both machines ARE on the same network, you can skip ngrok and use `http://<local-ip>:8080` instead.

### 4. Edit config.json (on the Pi)

Open `Personal-Safety-Device-main/config.json`:

```json
{
  "device_id": "KAVACH-001",
  "serial_port": "/dev/ttyUSB2",
  "baud_rate": 115200,
  "sos_button_pin": 23,
  "police_number": "100",
  "guardian_number": "+919876543210",
  "medical_number": "+919876543211",
  "server_url": "https://your-name.ngrok-free.dev/api/alerts",
  "server_public_url": "https://your-name.ngrok-free.dev/uploads/",
  "evidence_dir": "evidence",
  "whatsapp_number": "+919876543210",
  "whatsapp_apikey": "YOUR_CALLMEBOT_APIKEY",
  "api_token": "YOUR_UNWIREDLABS_API_TOKEN",
  "device_key": "kavach-device-key-2026"
}
```

Replace:
- `guardian_number` — your guardian's real phone number
- `medical_number` — a medical contact's number
- `your-name.ngrok-free.dev` — your actual ngrok domain
- `serial_port` — check with `ls /dev/ttyUSB*` after plugging in the SIM7600
- `whatsapp_number` — your WhatsApp number with country code (for alerts)
- `whatsapp_apikey` — your CallMeBot API key (see WhatsApp setup in Features section)
- `api_token` — your Unwired Labs API token (sign up free at [unwiredlabs.com](https://unwiredlabs.com), get 100 requests/day)
- `device_key` — must match the server's `KAVACH_DEVICE_KEY` env var (default: `kavach-device-key-2026`)

### 5. Download the Audio AI Model (on the Pi, once)

```bash
cd Personal-Safety-Device-main
python setup_audio.py
```

This downloads `yamnet.tflite` and `yamnet_class_map.csv` into `models/`.

### 6. Connect the Pi Camera

Plug the Pi Camera Module into the CSI port on the Raspberry Pi. Verify it works:
```bash
libcamera-hello --timeout 5000
```

If you see a 5-second preview window, the camera is working. If not connected, the code falls back to `FakeCameraRecorder` (no crash, just no video evidence).

### 7. Wire the Hardware

```
Physical Button   → GPIO 23 (BCM) + GND
Pi Camera Module  → CSI port (ribbon cable)
SIM7600 module    → USB (/dev/ttyUSB2)
BNO055 (IMU)      → I2C (SDA/SCL)
MAX30102 (Heart)  → I2C (SDA/SCL)
INA219 (Battery)  → I2C (SDA/SCL)
SX1278 (LoRa)     → SPI + GPIO pins
Microphone        → USB or 3.5mm (via sounddevice)
```

Any sensor not connected will be automatically replaced by a simulator — the device will not crash.

## Running the Project

### Build the Mobile App (on Windows PC — one time)

```bash
cd kavach_app
flutter pub get
flutter build apk --debug
```

The APK will be at `kavach_app/build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk`. Transfer it to your Android phone and install.

**Requirements:** Flutter SDK 3.41+, Android SDK, Dart SDK 3.11+.

### Start the Server FIRST (on Windows PC — one command)

```bash
cd Kavach-Server-main
.\start.bat
```

This single command will:
1. Create a Python virtual environment (first time only)
2. Install all dependencies from `Requirements.txt`
3. Start the Flask server on port 8080
4. Launch ngrok tunnel automatically
5. Open the dashboard in your browser

**Admin Login:** Username `admin`, Password `kavach2026`. Change via environment variables `KAVACH_ADMIN_USER` and `KAVACH_ADMIN_PASS`.

Verify: open `https://your-name.ngrok-free.dev/` in your browser — you'll see the login page. After logging in, you'll see the admin dashboard with map, stats, alerts, and evidence files.

### Start the Device (on the Raspberry Pi — can be anywhere in the world)

```bash
cd Personal-Safety-Device-main
python main.py
```

Expected output:
```
Kavach ARMED — State=IDLE ActiveAlert=none
Triggers active:
  Button single press  → SOS
  Button double press  → MEDICAL ALERT
  Button long press 5s → SAFE (cancel + notify)
  IMU fall detected    → SOS
  Heart rate spike     → SOS
  Audio danger sound   → SOS (YAMNet)
  Camera               → Video evidence recording during alerts
  Microphone           → Audio evidence recording during alerts
  LoRa RX              → Mesh relay (if SX1278 connected)

Keyboard shortcuts (works on Pi and desktop):
  f → Fall detected      h → Heart rate spike
  a → Audio danger       s → SOS (button press)
  d → MEDICAL (double press)  l → SAFE (long press)
  q → Quit
```

## New Features (v3.0)

### 1. Admin Web Dashboard
Open `https://your-name.ngrok-free.dev/` (or `http://localhost:8080/`) to see:
- **Admin login** — username/password required to access the dashboard (with splash screen and Kavach logo)
- **Dark theme** — modern dark design with cyan accent and color-coded stats
- **Stats bar** — total alerts, SOS count, medical count, active devices, evidence files
- **Live map** — Leaflet.js + CartoDB dark tiles with colored markers (red=SOS, purple=MEDICAL, blue=other)
- **Active Devices panel** — click a device to expand its alerts, click an alert to see detail with GPS, battery, call/SMS status, and evidence files (Open/Save buttons)
- **All Alerts table** — full table with trigger type badges (SOS Button, Fall Detected, Heart Rate Spike, Danger Sound, etc.)
- **Auto-refresh** every 30 seconds
- **Sign Out** button in header

### 2. Mobile App API Endpoints
REST API endpoints used by the Kavach Flutter app:

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Purpose |
|--------|----------|------|---------|
| `POST` | `/api/auth/signup` | None | Create user/guardian account (custom password) |
| `POST` | `/api/auth/login` | None | Get auth token (device_id + role + password) |
| `GET` | `/api/user/alerts` | User token | All alerts for the user's device |
| `GET` | `/api/guardian/alerts` | Guardian token | SOS/MEDICAL alerts only |
| `GET` | `/api/user/locations` | User token | Location history |
| `GET` | `/api/user/config` | User token | Get device phone numbers |
| `PUT` | `/api/user/config` | User token | Update phone numbers (syncs to Pi) |
| `GET` | `/api/guardian/evidence/<id>` | Guardian token | Evidence files (returns signed download URLs) |
| `GET` | `/api/device/config/<id>` | Device key | Pi polls for config + sends battery heartbeat |
| `GET` | `/api/device/status/<id>` | User/Guardian token | Live device battery + online/offline |

Tokens are signed with itsdangerous (bundled with Flask) and expire after 24 hours. Passwords are hashed with pbkdf2 (via werkzeug).

### 3. Audio Evidence Recording
During SOS/MEDICAL alerts, the microphone records 42-second `.wav` clips alongside camera video:
- 16 kHz mono, 16-bit PCM
- Saved to `evidence/` folder
- Encrypted and uploaded with other evidence files
- Uses `sounddevice` library — **auto-disables** if no real USB/I2S microphone is detected
- Rejects virtual devices (PulseAudio "pulse", HDMI outputs, monitor sinks)
- Camera and audio recording start 3 seconds apart to prevent memory spikes on Pi

### 4. Offline Upload Queue
If the server is unreachable during an alert:
- Failed uploads are queued in memory
- Each 60-second update cycle retries queued uploads first
- Successfully retried uploads are removed from queue
- Queue resets on device restart (by design — no stale data)

### 5. Low Battery WhatsApp Alert
When battery drops below 15%:
- Sends a WhatsApp message to the configured number via CallMeBot API
- Sent **once per boot** to avoid spam (resets on restart)
- Skipped if WhatsApp is not configured

### 6. WhatsApp Alerts for SOS/MEDICAL
During SOS and MEDICAL alerts:
- Sends location + help message via WhatsApp (CallMeBot API)
- **Only sends location and help message** — no video/evidence on WhatsApp
- Gracefully skips if `whatsapp_number` or `whatsapp_apikey` are placeholder values

**WhatsApp Setup (one-time):**
1. Save `+34 644 51 95 23` in your phone as "CallMeBot"
2. Send "I allow callmebot to send me messages" on WhatsApp to that number
3. You'll receive an API key
4. Put the API key in `config.json` → `"whatsapp_apikey"`
5. Put your WhatsApp number in `config.json` → `"whatsapp_number"` (e.g. `"+919876543210"`)

## Security Features

- **End-to-end encryption** — All telemetry AND evidence files encrypted with ChaCha20-Poly1305
- **Evidence file encryption** — Video clips, audio clips, and images are encrypted before leaving the Pi
- **Evidence integrity** — SHA-256 hashes of original files sent alongside; server verifies after decryption
- **Live re-verification** — Server re-computes hashes on demand when viewing an alert detail
- **No plaintext in transit** — GPS coordinates, alert type, battery status, AND evidence files are all encrypted
- **Authenticated API** — All data routes require admin session, Bearer token, or device key (no public access to alerts, evidence, or config)
- **Signed download URLs** — Evidence file links include a 1-hour signed token so the app can open files in the browser without exposing raw `/uploads/` paths
- **Device key auth** — Pi authenticates to the server via `X-Device-Key` header when polling config
- **Cell tower fallback** — Even without GPS, approximate location is obtained via cell tower triangulation
- **Persistent auth tokens** — Server SECRET_KEY saved to `.secret_key` file, survives restarts

| 9 | Evidence dir auto-created | `os.makedirs(evidence_dir, exist_ok=True)` prevents upload failures if folder missing |
| 10 | XSS protection | Dashboard HTML-escapes all user-controlled data (device_id, trigger_source, etc.) |
| 11 | Password security | Switched from bare SHA-256 to werkzeug pbkdf2 with salt. Backwards-compatible with legacy hashes |
| 12 | Phone number validation | Config update endpoint validates phone numbers against regex before saving |
| 13 | App null token fix | Bearer header no longer sends literal "null" when token is missing |
| 14 | App response handling | All API calls now handle non-JSON responses (ngrok errors, 500s) without crashing |
| 15 | App token expiry | Auto-clears credentials on 401, prompting re-login instead of showing generic errors |
| 16 | Battery parse fix | `AlertModel` now safely parses battery percentage as string or number (handles "N/A", "93%", etc.) |

## Bug Fixes (v3.1)

| # | Bug | Fix |
|---|-----|-----|
| 1 | Evidence upload grabbed ALL files in `evidence/`, including files from old alerts | Added `alert_start_time` filter — only uploads files created after the current alert started |
| 2 | Offline retry queue held detached SQLAlchemy objects after `session.close()` | Added `_AlertSnapshot` class — queue stores plain Python objects with copied attributes |
| 3 | Cell tower accuracy log had `\r\nOK` garbage from AT command response | Isolate CLBS data line (split on `\n`) before parsing fields |
| 4 | `has_internet()` downloaded full Google homepage (~100KB) on every check | Changed `requests.get` → `requests.head` (fetches headers only) |
| 5 | Server `SECRET_KEY` regenerated on every restart, invalidating all auth tokens | Key now persists to `.secret_key` file on first run, reloaded on subsequent starts |

## Changes (v3.4) — Security + Live Battery

| # | Change | Details |
|---|--------|---------|
| 1 | **Server route authentication** | `GET /api/alerts`, `/api/alerts/<id>` now require admin session or Bearer token. `GET /uploads/<file>` requires session, token, or signed download URL. `GET /api/device/config/<id>` requires `X-Device-Key` header. No data routes are publicly accessible |
| 2 | **Signed evidence download URLs** | Evidence URLs returned by the API include a 1-hour signed token (`?token=xxx`). Allows the app to open files in an external browser without needing auth headers |
| 3 | **Device key authentication** | Pi sends `X-Device-Key` header when polling `/api/device/config`. Server validates against `KAVACH_DEVICE_KEY` env var (default: `kavach-device-key-2026`). Added `device_key` field to `config.json` |
| 4 | **Battery heartbeat** | Pi sends `X-Battery` header (e.g. `85%`) with every config poll (every 10s). Server stores battery + last-seen timestamp in memory per device |
| 5 | **Live device status endpoint** | New `GET /api/device/status/<device_id>` returns battery percentage + online/offline. Device is "offline" if no heartbeat in 2 minutes |
| 6 | **Live battery on app dashboard** | User dashboard now shows "Device Online/Offline" with live battery percentage instead of server uptime. Polls every 60 seconds. Shows "No heartbeat received" when device is offline |
| 7 | **Battery display fix** | Removed double `%%` bug in dashboard HTML and Flutter alert detail screen. Battery is stored as `"85%"` (string with `%`), so UI no longer appends an extra `%` |
| 8 | **WhatsApp integration** | All alert sequences (SOS, MEDICAL, SAFE) now send WhatsApp messages via CallMeBot. Low-battery WhatsApp alert at 15% (once per boot). Silently skips if not configured |
| 9 | **API token guard** | Cell tower fallback in `comms.py` skips gracefully if `api_token` starts with `YOUR_` (placeholder detection) |

## Changes (v3.5) — Dark Theme, Notifications, Camera Fix

| # | Change | Details |
|---|--------|---------|
| 1 | **Dark theme dashboard** | Complete redesign: dark background, cyan accents, Kavach logo, splash screen on login |
| 2 | **Active Devices panel** | Replaced "Recent Alerts" with device-centric view. Click device → expand alerts → click alert → inline detail with GPS, battery, call/SMS status, and evidence files |
| 3 | **Trigger name badges** | Friendly names: SOS Button, Fall Detected, Heart Rate Spike, Danger Sound, LoRa Mesh Relay, SOS Trigger (keyboard) |
| 4 | **App push notifications** | `flutter_local_notifications` polls every 5 seconds. Shows notification with sound when new SOS/MEDICAL alert arrives |
| 5 | **App splash screen** | Animated Kavach logo with "Your Safety, Our Priority" caption on app launch |
| 6 | **Custom launcher icon** | Kavach logo replaces default Flutter icon on Android home screen |
| 7 | **Camera fix (rpicam-vid)** | Replaced picamera2 with `rpicam-vid` subprocess for Pi Camera recording. 30-second MP4 clips |
| 8 | **Staggered clip durations** | Video=30s, Audio=42s — LCM=210s (3.5 min), so clips never restart simultaneously (avoids memory spikes on Pi) |
| 9 | **Config poll 10s** | Device polls server every 10 seconds (was 60s) for faster config sync and battery heartbeat |
| 10 | **Keyboard on Pi** | Keyboard demo keys (f/h/a/s/d/l/q) now work on Pi alongside GPIO buttons for remote testing |
| 11 | **YAMNet fix** | Fixed download URL (403 error) and audio buffer size (15600 samples, not 16000) |
| 12 | **Evidence file auth fix** | Guardian app now uses signed download URLs. Removed `canLaunchUrl` check for Android 11+ compatibility |
| 13 | **start.sh for Pi** | Automated setup script: installs PortAudio, creates venv, pip install, downloads YAMNet, generates key, launches device |
| 14 | **GPS display fix** | Coordinates rounded to 6 decimal places in app UI |
| 15 | **LoRa auto-disable** | LoRa silently disables when no SX1278 hardware is connected (no more fake packet simulation or log spam). Auto-activates when hardware is wired |
| 16 | **Audio recorder auto-disable** | Audio recorder rejects virtual devices (PulseAudio "pulse", HDMI, monitor sinks) and silently disables. Only activates with a real USB/I2S microphone |
| 17 | **Staggered evidence start** | Camera and audio recording start 3 seconds apart during SOS/MEDICAL to prevent memory spike segfaults on Pi |

---

## Changes (v3.6) — Stability + Security

| # | Change | Details |
|---|--------|---------|
| 1 | **TFLite/ChaCha20 segfault fix** | Root cause identified: YAMNet shutdown race condition. Detached inference threads could touch freed TFLite native memory, corrupting the heap. Next ChaCha20 encryption call (via `_cffi_backend`/OpenSSL) would segfault. Fix: `shutdown()` now joins inference threads + uses `_infer_lock` before releasing the interpreter |
| 2 | **ARM/Pi TFLite guard** | Full TensorFlow (`tensorflow`) on ARM/Pi causes segfaults during ChaCha20 encryption due to native memory conflicts with `_cffi_backend`. The code now blocks `tensorflow.lite` on ARM and requires `tflite-runtime` (Python 3.9-3.12). If unavailable, YAMNet falls back to keyboard-trigger simulation mode |
| 3 | **Singleton ChaCha20 cipher** | `ChaCha20Poly1305` object created once at import time (before TFLite loads) in `crypto_utils.py`. Reused for all encrypt/decrypt calls. Prevents cffi initialisation conflicts with other C extensions |
| 4 | **Evidence SMS removed** | Evidence download links are no longer sent via SMS. Evidence files are only accessible through the server dashboard and mobile app (more secure — no URLs in plain text SMS) |
| 5 | **Immediate telemetry upload** | SOS/MEDICAL sequences upload telemetry to server immediately (before camera starts), so the mobile app sees the alert within 5 seconds. Camera starts after upload completes to avoid RAM contention |
| 6 | **Location source tracking** | GPS vs Cell Tower source displayed everywhere: SMS messages, server dashboard, mobile app alert detail. Stored as `location_source` field in database |

---

## Changes (v3.7) — Alert Consolidation + App Auto-Refresh

| # | Change | Details |
|---|--------|---------|
| 1 | **Video clip duration** | Camera now records 30-second MP4 clips (was 25s). Staggered durations: Video=30s, Audio=42s, LCM=210s (3.5 min) — clips never restart simultaneously, avoiding memory spikes on Pi |
| 2 | **Evidence no longer sent via SMS** | Evidence files are only accessible through the Kavach app and server dashboard. No download links are sent via SMS (more secure — no URLs in plain text messages) |
| 3 | **Alert consolidation** | One button press = one alert row in the database. Location updates, evidence file uploads, and battery readings all update the **same** alert row instead of creating new rows. Prevents duplicate alert entries per SOS event |
| 4 | **App auto-refresh** | All mobile app screens auto-refresh every 10 seconds. Alert detail screen refreshes every 5 seconds. No manual pull-to-refresh needed — the app always shows the latest data |
